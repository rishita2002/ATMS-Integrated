# Advanced Transportation Management System (ATMS) for Agri-Food Supply Chain

## Introduction
The agri-food supply chain faces significant challenges in transportation and distribution, including complex operations, multiple stakeholders, diverse transportation modes, changing environmental conditions, and the constant need to optimize routes while minimizing costs. This README provides an overview of our Advanced Transportation Management System (ATMS) project, which aims to address these unique challenges by designing and developing a specialized transportation management system tailored specifically to the agri-food supply chain.

## Project Overview
Project Objective: The primary objective of this project is to design and develop an ATMS tailored to the agri-food supply chain to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure the timely and safe delivery of products.

Key Features:

Route Optimization: Our ATMS provides advanced route optimization capabilities to minimize transportation costs and delivery times while considering real-time factors like traffic and weather conditions.

Real-time taking: Stakeholder gets all the real-time information about product in email.

Inventory: Contains all the information about Available product.

Analytics and reporting: Provides all the information through visualization.

Compliance: Contains information about warehouses and items stored in it.

Environmental Considerations: The system factors in environmental conditions to support eco-friendly transportation decisions.
